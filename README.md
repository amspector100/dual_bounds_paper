# README

This repository contains code to replicate the experments in the first draft of Ji, Lei and Spector (2023).

**Note**: Before the next arXiv version, we plan to make an easy-to-use package implementing dual bounds available with documentation, examples, etc. However, the final package is under construction and not yet available, but it will be soon!

## Running the simulations

To reproduce the experimental results, simply navigate to the ``sims/`` folder and run ``bash lee_sims.sh``. The figures are then produced in ``notebooks/figures.ipynb``.

## Running the tests

Run ``python3.9 -m pytest`` to run the unit tests. This should take less than 10 seconds.
